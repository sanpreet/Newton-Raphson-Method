### Conditions applied

---

* Iteration will run till the value which is set by the user.
```
    final_value=int(input("Enter the times you want to iterate the program:")) #this is the limit till iteration should continue
```
* Till the value of f(x) becomes very small nearly approaches to zero
```
 while(abs(f_value)>small_value and counter<final_value):
 ```
